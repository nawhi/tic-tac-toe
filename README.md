# Tic Tac Toe Kata

The rules of the tic tac toe game are the following:

* There are two players in the game (X and O)
* A game has nine fields in a 3x3 grid
* Players take turns taking fields until the game is over
* A player can only take a field if it is currently unoccupied

A player wins the game when any of the following are satisfied:
* all fields in a row are taken by that player
* all fields in a diagonal are taken by that player 
* all fields in a column are taken by that player

The game is a draw if neither player wins and all fields on the game are occupied.
